All notable changes are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- Project scaffolded from DevBlueprint (Web app (Next.js + pnpm)).
- Fix the CI install gate: allowlist the `unrs-resolver` native build script via pnpm 11's
  `allowBuilds` so `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` no longer exits with
  ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS.
- Pass a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the gitleaks action, which now requires it to scan pull requests.
- Let `pnpm test` pass on the empty scaffold (`vitest --passWithNoTests`) until the first tests
  land, and ignore `*.tsbuildinfo`.
